ipc144-s13
==========

This is repo contains class examples for students taking IPC144 in Summer 2013 at Seneca College.


You can get the code contained here by doing the following:

First time (do this only the first time).  
----------------------------------------

* Log onto matrix.
* Go to the directory where you would like your code examples for this class to go (if you want it at top level, skip this step)
* type: git clone git@github.com:cathyatseneca/ipc144-s13.git

This will create a folder called ipc144-s13 in your current directory.  Go into that and into the correct folder for your section for code updates

All other times (to update after class):
----------------

* Log onto matrix.
* go into the ipc144-s13 directory
* type: git pull origin
